# Hello World File for Data Science Class Project
--------------------------------
## This is a markdown file
This markdown file was created as an empty file with the touch command in Terminal under MacOSX 7.5, then edited with TextEdit.
It was easier to create it in TextEdit than in RStudio due to missing packages (knitr and its dependencies)
